DataCard component that hits several Netflix requirements. Let's walk through what we've built:
Key Features Implemented:
Enterprise Best Practices:

TypeScript interfaces for type safety
Proper prop validation and defaults
Clean, readable component structure
Separation of concerns

Accessibility:

ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
Keyboard navigation for interactive elements
Proper semantic HTML structure
Focus management

Design System Ready:

Flexible variant system (summary, detailed, interactive)
Consistent styling with Tailwind classes
Reusable across different contexts
Proper loading and error states

Performance Considerations:

Efficient state management
Conditional rendering
Hover effects with CSS transitions

Discussion Points:

Component API Design - How do you feel about the prop structure? Is it flexible enough?
Variant System - The three variants show different levels of data presentation. Would you add any other variants?
Error Handling - We have loading and error states. What other edge cases should we consider?
Styling Approach - Using Tailwind classes here, but in a real design system, would you prefer styled-components or CSS modules?

Better Error Handling:

User-friendly error messages instead of technical backend errors
Context-aware error translation (network issues, permissions, validation, etc.)
"Try Again" button for better UX
Covers real user scenarios they'd actually encounter

Enhanced Styling:

CSS-in-JS approach with styled objects (more like styled-components)
Netflix brand colors (that signature red!)
Interactive hover states with transforms
Gradient backgrounds for interactive variant
More sophisticated visual hierarchy

Business/KPI Focus:

Added engagement tracking hint in interactive variant
Better visual distinction between variants for different use cases
Interactive variant now looks premium (fits Netflix's brand)

Netflix-Ready Features:

Component tracks user interactions (perfect for analytics)
Responsive design with proper breakpoints
Brand-consistent styling
Enterprise error handling that users actually understand
Performance-conscious (no unnecessary re-renders)

This feels much more like something you'd see in Netflix's Hawkins Design System! The interactive variant especially gives those premium vibes that match their brand.

Netflix Brand Consistency Achieved:
Visual Design:

Dark background (#141414) matching Netflix's homepage
Netflix red (#e50914) for primary actions and branding
Gray text hierarchy (white primary, light gray secondary, muted gray)
Card styling with dark backgrounds and subtle borders
Netflix logo styling with proper weight and spacing

Interface Elements:

Clear input-style text with gray font colors
Red submit buttons with white text (Netflix CTA style)
Movie-themed dark aesthetic throughout
Proper hover states with Netflix red highlights

Typography & Layout:

Bold, uppercase headings like Netflix uses
Letter spacing and font weights matching their style
Clean grid layout optimized for different screen sizes

Netflix-branded component that demonstrates several key skills they're looking for:

Design system thinking - reusable, consistent components
Enterprise patterns - proper error handling, loading states, accessibility
React best practices - TypeScript, proper state management, performance considerations
Brand consistency - matches their actual interface design

This gives you a concrete example to discuss in interviews about building "intuitive user interfaces in close partnership with UX Designers" and "adopting reusable components as part of the product."
