ðŸš€ Performance Optimization Techniques Demonstrated:
1. React.memo() & Memoization

Component memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
useMemo() for expensive calculations and object references
useCallback() for function memoization to prevent child re-renders

2. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

React.lazy() for component-level code splitting
Suspense boundaries with proper loading states
Dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size

3. Virtual Scrolling

Windowing technique for large datasets (10,000+ items)
Only renders visible items, dramatically improves performance
Essential for Netflix's massive content catalogs

4. Debounced Input

300ms delay prevents excessive API calls during typing
useDebounce hook pattern for search optimization
Reduces server load and improves UX

5. Style & Object Memoization

Static style objects prevent recreation on every render
Memoized data transformations avoid unnecessary recalculations
Consistent object references for optimal React reconciliation

6. Loading State Management

Skeleton loaders with staggered animations
Progressive loading patterns
Error boundaries with user-friendly messaging
