ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy Breakdown:
1. Unit Testing (70% of test suite)
Focus: Individual component behavior, pure functions, utilities

Component rendering - Does it render correctly?
Props handling - Does it respond to prop changes?
State management - Does internal state work properly?
Event handling - Do click/input events work?

2. Integration Testing (20% of test suite)
Focus: Component interactions, API integration, user workflows

Parent-child communication - Do callbacks work?
API mocking - Does it handle API responses/errors?
User workflows - Can users complete tasks?
Debounced interactions - Do performance optimizations work?

3. End-to-End Testing (10% of test suite)
Focus: Critical user journeys, real browser testing

Complete user flows - Sign up â†’ Browse â†’ Watch
Cross-browser compatibility - Works in all target browsers
Real API integration - Tests against actual backend

4. Specialized Testing Areas:
Performance Testing:

Render time budgets (< 100ms for components)
Bundle size monitoring
Memory leak detection
Debounce/throttle effectiveness

Accessibility Testing:

Screen reader compatibility
Keyboard navigation
Color contrast ratios
ARIA attributes and roles

Visual Regression Testing:

UI consistency across deployments
Cross-browser visual differences
Component library consistency

ðŸŽ¯ Netflix Interview Talking Points:
Testing Philosophy:

Test pyramid approach (more unit, fewer E2E)
User-centric testing - test behavior, not implementation
Fast feedback loops - unit tests run in < 1 second

Advanced Patterns:

Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking
Custom render utilities with providers pre-configured
Page Object Models for E2E test maintainability
Parallel test execution for faster CI/CD

Netflix-Specific Considerations:

A/B testing compatibility - components work with feature flags
Internationalization testing - UI works in multiple languages
Performance budgets - strict limits on bundle size and render time
Accessibility compliance - WCAG 2.1 AA standard

The interactive demo shows real components with proper test IDs and accessibility attributes - exactly what you'd implement at Netflix!

This approach gives you:
âœ… Working interactive demo - Real components you can interact with
âœ… Comprehensive test examples - Shows proper testing patterns and structure
âœ… No dependency issues - Pure React code that runs in the artifact environment
âœ… Educational value - Comments explain the testing concepts and best practices

The demo now shows:

Live components that exhibit the behaviors you'd test
Realistic test code examples (commented but complete)
Testing strategy overview with the Netflix testing pyramid
Best practices embedded in the code comments

You can copy these test examples into your markdown files and they'll serve as perfect reference material for Netflix interviews. The patterns shown are exactly what they'd expect to see in a senior UI engineering role!
